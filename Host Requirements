Your host system should have the following software with the minimum versions indicated. 
This should not be an issue for most modern Linux distributions. 
Also note that many distributions will place software headers into separate packages, often in the form of
“<package-name>-devel” or “<package-name>-dev”. Be sure to install those if your distribution provides them.
This build of InterGenOS was completed on an ArchLinux host system, with all available 'devel' type packages
for the requirements listed below installed.

Bash-3.2 (/bin/sh should be a symbolic or hard link to bash)
Binutils-2.17 (Versions greater than 2.25 are not recommended as they have not been tested)
Bison-2.3 (/usr/bin/yacc should be a link to bison or small script that executes bison)
Bzip2-1.0.4
Coreutils-6.9
Diffutils-2.8.1
Findutils-4.2.31
Gawk-4.0.1 (/usr/bin/awk should be a link to gawk)
GCC-4.5.x including the C++ compiler, g++
    
    **  Some libraries used by gcc can be in an inconsistent state that interferes with building some InterGenOS
    **  packages. To check this, look in /usr/lib and possibly /usr/lib64 for libgmp.la, libmpfr.la, and libmpc.la. 
    **  Either all three should be present or absent, but not only one or two. If the problem exists on your system, 
    **  either rename or delete the .la files or install the appropriate missing package.
        
Glibc-2.10.x
Grep-2.5.1a
Gzip-1.3.12
Linux Kernel-3.5.x
M4-1.4.10
Make-3.81
Patch-2.5.4
Perl-5.8.8
Sed-4.1.5
Tar-1.18
Xz-5.0.0

The additional req_check.sh and lib_check.sh scripts can be used to assist in verifying the requirements
