Use cfdisk or fdisk with a command line option naming the hard disk on which the build partition will be createdâ€”
  for example /dev/sda for the primary disk. 
  
Create an ext4 Linux native partition, and also create a small swap partition if the host machine has less than 6GB 
of physical RAM.

# Create build file system
mkfs -v -t ext4 /dev/<sdx>

# Create swap if needed
mkswap /dev/<sdy>

# Choose a mount point and assign it to the InterGenOS environment variable
export IGOS=/mnt/igos

    ** Add the above listed export line to both your ~/.bash_profile, and your /root/.bash_profile
    ** so that it will be sourced into the environment at every boot.

# Verify the environment variable is in place
echo $IGOS
## Expected return:
/mnt/igos

# Create the mount point and mount the IGOS file system
mkdir -pv $IGOS
mount -v -t ext4 /dev/<sdx> $IGOS

# Enable swap if needed
/sbin/swapon -v /dev/<sdy>
